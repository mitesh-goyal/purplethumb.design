    {
        ques: "So...how does this all work then?",
        ans: "Simple! Submit design requests, and order them according to your priority. If we have any questions we will respond promptly, otherwise we will deliver you designs in just a few days. If you're not satisfied, no worries, we will continue to revise the designs until you're completely satisfied."
    },
    {
        ques: "How fast will I get designs?",
        ans: "Typically, most requests are completed in just 1-5 business days. However, larger requests can take a bit longer, depending on complexity. For example, if a request for social media assets may take 1 business day. But, a request for a new full page design it may take up to 4 days for the first draft. All designs are uniquely created based on your requirements."
    },
    {
        ques: "How do I send design requests and communicate with Purplethumb?",
        ans: "Flexibility and meeting client needs is key here at Purplethumb. The most common way to request designs is directly in your design board via Notion. There you can share any type of files related to your request like example images, Google Docs, or even brief Loom videos to describe your request.."
    },
    {
        ques: "Who's doing all this amazing work?",
        ans: "This may be surprising, but all the designs are done by less than 3 people. This means you'll work directly with the founder of Purplethumb, me! There is no middle-man, so you'll get the personal attention and top-notch quality you deserve. However, I may collaborate with some of my design partners for more complex tasks like detailed animations. Rest assured, I will be in charge of completing all of your requests."
    },
    {
        ques: "What if I don't like the designs?",
        ans: "No problem! If something isn't perfect on the first round, you have unlimited feedback revisions. We'll continue take your feedback and revise the designs until you are 200% satisfied."
    },
    {
        ques: "Is it really unlimited requests?",
        ans: "Yes, it really is! Once you've subscribed, you'll be able to add unlimited design requests to your queue, and they'll be completed one-by-one based on your priorities."
    },
    {
        ques: "Can I invite multiple teammates?",
        ans: "Of course! All Purplethumb plans allow for unlimited team members. All teammates will need to use the same design queue."
    },
    {
        ques: "What tools do you use for designs?",
        ans: "A variety of programs are used to create the designs, but all designs are delivered in Figma."
    },
    {
        ques: "I dont have multiple design needs. Can I make a single request?",
        ans: "Absolutely. Once the first design request is done, you can pause the subscription from your account. Also, you can come back and resume your subscription anytime you have new requests."
    },
    {
        ques: "What is your refund policy?",
        ans: "Unfortunately, if design work has started we don't offer any form of money-back guarantee, but if you're unsatisfied with our service, please get in touch and we'll do our best to make things right."
